A-Run-To-Get-Home
Hacky, the protagonist of our story is trying to get home after awakening in a strange city unknown to him. The game is based on an urban environment hostile to the player. 
A Run to get Home is a runner-type game where the main character, our hero, runs around the city obtaining coins and different types of gems. Each coin and gem has a different value in the game and these values are going to be relevant at the end of the level to designate how many stars the player gets. To pass the level, the player needs to get at least 2 stars out of 5.
When running, Hacky needs to avoid obstacles such as garbage bins, vehicles, constructions pedestrians and other things related to the environment. If Hacky collides with any obstacle, he loses some coins and his life bar decreases by one. When the life bar gets to 0, the game is over and the level needs to be restarted.
